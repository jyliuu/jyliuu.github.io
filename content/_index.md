# About

-- Born on 14. August 2002 in Shenzhen, China

I am a 3+5 PhD student at the University of Copenhagen. My research interests lie in statistical learning, interpretable machine learning, and super learning. I obtained a Bachelor's degree in Mathematics from UCPH in June 2023, with a specialization in statistics, and a strong focus on measure and probability theory.

In addition, I have experience in software engineering and DevOps. I am proficient in Python and have worked with frontend technologies such as React and Vue. I have applied these skills in developing machine learning microservices on the Google Cloud Platform.
